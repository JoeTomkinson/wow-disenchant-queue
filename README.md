# Disenqueue

A lightweight disenchant queue that processes **one item per hardware input** - fully compliant with Blizzard's one-action-per-keypress rules. Scan your bags, bind a key (or your scroll wheel), and shred through items safely and efficiently.

Also supports the **Lesser Professions**™ - Prospecting and Milling - for those of us who recognise that Enchanting is the one true craft and everything else is just breaking rocks and grinding weeds.

## Features

- **One action per input** - processes exactly one queued item per key/wheel press, staying within Blizzard's hardware input rules at all times
- **Smart bag scanning** - automatically detects disenchantable gear in your bags based on configurable quality filters
- **Scroll wheel workflow** - bind Mouse Wheel Up/Down and scroll through your disenchant pile in seconds
- **Alt+Click bag integration** - Alt+Click items in your bags to toggle queue membership directly
- **Item locking** - permanently protect valuable items so they never enter the queue, with manual lock and auto-lock support
- **Auto-protection** - items that fail disenchant twice are automatically locked to prevent repeated attempts
- **Import/Export locked lists** - share your protected item lists between characters or with friends via compact encoded strings
- **Lesser Professions** - optionally queue Prospecting (ore stacks of 5+) and Milling (herb stacks of 5+) alongside disenchants
- **Soulbound filter** - optionally restrict scanning to soulbound items only, keeping tradeable/AH-sellable gear safe
- **Dust estimation** - quality-based gold value estimates displayed in the queue header
- **Progress tracking** - live count, ETA, and percentage bar during processing
- **Resizable queue window** - drag grip to resize (4–16 visible rows) with snap-to-row and position persistence
- **Minimap button** - click to toggle the queue window; draggable with angle persistence, optional hide via settings
- **Customisable notifications** - toggle chat messages for scanning, processing, warnings, and queue changes independently
- **Custom themed UI** - dark-violet design with animated chrome, cast bar, quality-bordered icons, and companion locked items panel
- **Zero combat footprint** - does nothing during combat; fully unloads keybinds when not processing

## Settings

Access via **Settings → AddOns → Disenqueue** or the gear icon in the UI header.

**General**

- Process Key - Scroll Wheel, Enter, Space, F, E, or R
- Minimum/Maximum Quality - filter which item rarities get queued (Poor through Epic)
- Soulbound Only - only queue soulbound gear
- Minimap Button - show/hide the minimap toggle button

**Notifications**

**Lesser Professions** *(subcategory)*

---

## Lesser Professions

When enabled, Scan Bags also queues:

- **Prospecting** - ore stacks of 5+ (Jewelcrafting)
- **Milling** - herb stacks of 5+ (Inscription)

Items are grouped by mode in the queue (disenchants first, then prospect, then mill) and the correct spell is cast automatically. Stack-based items keep processing until the stack drops below 5.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

**Item not appearing in queue?**
Run `/wdq build` again after opening your bags. Uncached items may appear on a second scan.

**Nothing happens when I scroll?**
Make sure the keybind is set in Key Bindings → AddOns → Disenqueue, and that you've clicked Start in the UI.

**"Disenchant spell not known"?**
The current character doesn't have the Enchanting profession or hasn't learned Disenchant.

**Will this get me banned?**
No. Disenqueue processes exactly one item per hardware input event, which is the same rule Blizzard applies to all actions. It does not automate, queue multiple actions, or bypass any restrictions.
